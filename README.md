### Reflections and Comments
* Talking about myself is extrememly uncomfortable for me.
* VS code is very handy with the extensions provided, I am excited to learn more extension when their use becomes apparant.
* Holy guacamole, I felt confident after class, then my brain let out a stinker. Getting it together though. I'm supposed to be frightened and nauseous,....right?
